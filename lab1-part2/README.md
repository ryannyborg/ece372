# Description
In this lab, you will build on lab1-part1 to control an LCD screen and print out characters.

## Expected Outcome
For this lab, a simple "Hello!" should display on the first line of the LCD screen.

# Instructions
Examine comments in lcd.cpp and timer.cpp and complete the described functions. You will need to create a circuit using your breadboard, jumper wires, and soldered LCD.

## Required Connections
LCD Data Bit 4 (DB4) 	-- 	RA0 <br>
LCD Data Bit 5 (DB5)  --	RA1 <br>
LCD Data Bit 6 (DB6)	--	RA2 <br>
LCD Data Bit 7 (DB7)  --  RA3

*It is up to you to figure out which pin number on the microcontroller corresponds to RA0, RA1, RA2, and RA3*
