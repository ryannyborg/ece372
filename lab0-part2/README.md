Project Name: lab0-part2

# Description
In this lab, you will build on lab0-part1 by controlling external LEDs with an external switch. Using a state machine implementation (a switch statement in the while loop) you will switch LEDs after a switch has been **pressed and released.**

## Expected Outcome
![Demo CountPages alpha](https://storage.googleapis.com/ece-gitlab/lab0p1.gif)

# Instructions
Examine comments in switch.cpp and main.cpp and complete the described function. You will need to create a circuit using your breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, switch and resistors to control the LEDs using the microcontroller.

## Required Connections
White LED 	-- 	RB4 <br>
Red LED		--	RB5 <br>
Yellow LED	--	RB6 <br>
Switch  --  RB3

*It is up to you to figure out which pin number on the microcontroller corresponds to RB4, RB5, RB6, and RB3*
